# Controllers 🎯

Controllers are the heart of AzuraJS applications. They provide a clean, object-oriented way to organize your API endpoints into logical and maintainable classes using TypeScript decorators.

<Callout type="info" title="Why Use Controllers?">
Controllers follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, promoting separation of concerns. They keep your routing logic organized and reduce code duplication.
</Callout>

## What is a Controller? 📚

A controller is a TypeScript class decorated with `@Controller` that groups related route handlers (endpoints). Each method in the controller represents a specific route and is decorated with HTTP method decorators like `@Get`, `@Post`, `@Put`, or `@Delete`.

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Post } from "azurajs/decorators";

@Controller("/api/products")
export class ProductController {
  @Get()
  list() {
    return { products: [] };
  }

  @Post()
  create() {
    return { message: "Product created" };
  }
}
```

## Controller Decorator 🏷️

The `@Controller(prefix?)` decorator accepts an optional prefix that will be applied to all routes within the class.

- **Basic Usage**: `@Controller("/users")` -> All routes will start with `/users`.
- **No Prefix**: `@Controller()` -> Routes will use only their own paths.
- **Nested Paths**: `@Controller("/api/v1/admin")` -> Long prefix for all routes.

## Parameter Injection 💉

AzuraJS makes it easy to access request data through parameter decorators:

| Decorator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `@Req()` | Injects the full request object. |
| `@Res()` | Injects the full response object. |
| `@Body()` | Injects the request body (parsed JSON). |
| `@Param(name)` | Injects a URL parameter (e.g., `:id`). |
| `@Query(name)` | Injects a query string parameter. |
| `@Headers(name)` | Injects a specific header or all headers. |
| `@Cookies(name)` | Injects a specific cookie or all cookies. |
| `@Ip()` | Injects the client's IP address. |

## Best Practices ✨

1.  **Single Responsibility**: Each controller should handle a single resource or domain (e.g., `UserController`, `OrderController`).
2.  **Use Services**: Keep heavy business logic in service classes, leaving the controller only to handle HTTP.
3.  **Consistent Responses**: Try to maintain a standard JSON response pattern across all methods.
4.  **Error Handling**: Use the `HttpError` class to throw errors with specific status codes.
