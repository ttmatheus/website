# Custom Servers 🛠️

While AzuraJS provides a built-in HTTP/HTTPS server through the `app.listen()` method, it is flexible enough to be integrated with your own Node.js servers (`http.createServer` or `https.createServer`). This offers full control over server configuration, allowing integrations with other libraries or specific initialization logic.

## Integrating with `http.createServer`

You can pass the `app.handler` function directly to your native HTTP server. This allows AzuraJS to process requests while you manage the server's lifecycle.

```typescript
import { AzuraClient } from "azurajs";
import { applyDecorators, Controller, Get } from "azurajs/decorators";
import * as http from "node:http";

@Controller("/api")
class MyController {
  @Get("/hello")
  hello() {
    return "Hello from the custom server!";
  }
}

const app = new AzuraClient();
applyDecorators(app, [MyController]);

const server = http.createServer(app.handler);

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("🚀 Custom HTTP server running at http://localhost:3000");
});
```

## Integrating with `https.createServer`

To use HTTPS, you will need to provide your SSL keys. The process is similar, but using the `https` module.

```typescript
import { AzuraClient } from "azurajs";
import { applyDecorators, Controller, Get } from "azurajs/decorators";
import * as https from "node:https";
import * as fs from "node:fs";

// Example certificates (replace with your own)
const privateKey = fs.readFileSync("path/to/your/key.pem", "utf8");
const certificate = fs.readFileSync("path/to/your/cert.pem", "utf8");

const credentials = { key: privateKey, cert: certificate };

@Controller("/api")
class SecureController {
  @Get("/secure-hello")
  secureHello() {
    return "Hello from the custom HTTPS server!";
  }
}

const app = new AzuraClient();
applyDecorators(app, [SecureController]);

const httpsServer = https.createServer(credentials, app.handler);

httpsServer.listen(3001, () => {
  console.log("🔒 Custom HTTPS server running at https://localhost:3001");
});
```

## Advantages of Custom Servers

*   **Full Control**: Manage the server lifecycle, events, and low-level configurations.
*   **Flexible Integration**: Combine AzuraJS with other server libraries or reverse proxies more granularly.
*   **Advanced Configurations**: Implement load balancing logic, WebSockets, or other network functionalities directly in your server.
