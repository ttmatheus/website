# Usage with JavaScript ☕

AzuraJS is designed with a TypeScript-first approach, leveraging decorators for an expressive API. However, it is fully compatible with **pure JavaScript** environments. In JavaScript, you will utilize the functional API provided by the `AzuraClient` instance instead of decorators.

## Project Configuration

JavaScript projects utilize `azura.config.js` for configuration. The setup is straightforward as no TypeScript compilation step is required.

**azura.config.js**

```javascript
const config = {
  environment: "development",
  server: {
    port: 3000,
  },
  logging: {
    enabled: true,
  },
};

export default config;
```

## Creating Functional Routes

When using JavaScript, routes are defined directly on the `app` instance using method handlers like `.get()`, `.post()`, `.put()`, and `.delete()`.

**src/index.js**

```javascript
import { AzuraClient } from "azurajs";

const app = new AzuraClient();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello from AzuraJS in JavaScript!");
});

app.post("/data", async (req, res) => {
  const body = await req.json();
  res.json({ received: body, status: "success" });
});

app.listen().then(() => {
  console.log("🚀 AzuraJS JS server running at http://localhost:3000");
});
```

## Accessing Request Data

Route handlers receive `req` and `res` objects, which correspond to `RequestServer` and `ResponseServer`. These objects provide direct access to request data such as parameters, query strings, and headers.

```javascript
app.get("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  const queryParam = req.query.search;
  const userAgent = req.headers["user-agent"];

  res.json({
    id: userId,
    search: queryParam,
    userAgent: userAgent,
  });
});
```
