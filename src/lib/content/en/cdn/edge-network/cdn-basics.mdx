<Callout type="success" title="High Performance">
`@azurajs/cdn` is an ultra-fast Edge Server designed to act as an intelligent caching layer between your users and your origin server.
</Callout>

AzuraJS CDN allows you to distribute static and dynamic content with minimal latency, utilizing memory and disk caching strategies, and offering integrated security through signed URLs.

## Installation

To get started with the CDN server, install the `@azurajs/cdn` package:

<Tabs items={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]}>
  <Tab value="npm">
```bash
npm install @azurajs/cdn
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm add @azurajs/cdn
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
```bash
yarn add @azurajs/cdn
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
```bash
bun add @azurajs/cdn
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Basic Configuration

The CDN is configured through a simple configuration object. Here is a basic initialization example:

```typescript
import { createCDN } from "@azurajs/cdn";

const cdn = createCDN({
  origin: "https://api.yourserver.com", // Your backend server URL
  server: {
    port: 4000,
    host: "0.0.0.0"
  },
  cache: {
    ttl: 3600, // Default cache time in seconds (1 hour)
    maxMemoryBytes: 1024 * 1024 * 512, // 512MB memory cache
  }
});

cdn.listen();
console.log("🚀 AzuraJS CDN running on port 4000");
```

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Multi-Layer Cache** | Support for memory (L1) and disk (L2) caching for maximum efficiency. |
| **Signed URLs** | Protect private resources with temporary links generated using HMAC SHA-256. |
| **Intelligent Purge** | Dedicated API to clear cache for specific routes instantly. |
| **Cache-Control Respect** | The CDN automatically honors `Cache-Control` headers from the origin. |

## Signed URLs (Security)

If you have sensitive files (e.g., `/private/document.pdf`), the CDN can require a valid signature to grant access.

```typescript
const cdn = createCDN({
  origin: "...",
  signedUrls: {
    secret: "your-super-secure-secret-key"
  }
});

// Generating a signed URL that expires in 5 minutes
const signedUrl = cdn.generateSignedUrl("/private/photo.png", 300);
console.log(signedUrl); 
// Output: /private/photo.png?expires=1738598400&sig=a1b2c3d4...
```

## Cache Purge

You can clear the cache for a specific route programmatically:

```typescript
// Removes cache for the route /assets/logo.png
cdn.purge("/assets/logo.png");
```

Or via a POST HTTP request to the special endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://cdn.your-site.com/__purge \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"path": "/assets/logo.png"}'
```
